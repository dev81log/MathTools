 # MathTools Project

## Overview

The MathTools project is a comprehensive Java-based application designed to perform a variety of mathematical operations. It includes a refactored `MathTools` class with methods for basic arithmetic, square and cubic roots, powers, factorial, Fibonacci sequence, prime number checking, least common multiple (LCM), and greatest common divisor (GCD). The project aims to provide a clean, readable, and maintainable codebase while offering robust functionality for mathematical computations.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with multiple integers.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: Calculate remainders with the modulus operation.
- **Powers and Roots**: Compute square and cubic roots, as well as squares and cubes of numbers.
- **Factorial**: Find the factorial of a given number.
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: Generate the Fibonacci number at a specific position in the sequence.
- **Prime Number Check**: Determine whether a number is prime.
- **Least Common Multiple (LCM) and Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: Compute the LCM and GCD of two numbers.

## Usage

1. **Initialization**: Instantiate the `MathTools` class to access various mathematical operations.
2. **Perform Operations**: Call the desired method from the `MathTools` class with appropriate parameters.
3. **View Results**: The methods return the result of the computation which can be printed or stored as needed.

## Example

MathTools tools = new MathTools();
int sum = tools.sumNumbers(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
